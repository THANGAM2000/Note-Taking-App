# Keeper - A Simple Note-Taking App

Keeper is a lightweight and intuitive web application for jotting down your thoughts, ideas, and reminders. It's built with React, offering a seamless user experience for creating and managing your notes.

## Features

  * **Create Notes:** Easily add new notes with a title and content.
  * **Delete Notes:** Remove notes that are no longer needed.
  * **Responsive Design:** (Assumed, based on typical React app structure) Works well on different screen sizes.
  * **Clean User Interface:** A straightforward and easy-to-use design.

## Technologies Used

  * **React.js:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  * **HTML5:** For the basic structure of the web application.
  * **CSS3:** For styling and layout (assuming a `style.css` or similar file is used, though not provided).

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

  * Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd keeper-app
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    This will open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another available port).

## Project Structure

The project is structured into several React components:

  * `App.jsx`: The main application component that manages the state of notes and renders other components.
  * `Header.jsx`: Displays the application's header with the title "Keeper".
  * `Footer.jsx`: Renders the copyright information at the bottom of the page.
  * `Note.jsx`: Represents an individual note, displaying its title, content, and a delete button.
  * `CreateArea.jsx`: Provides the input fields and button for creating new notes.
